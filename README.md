# Welcome to my pipeline for BIT104

# Alignment
When completing alignment to the genome, the bash scripts in the alignment_bash_scripts folder can be used, these are numbered by order with a deployment script for slurm jobs as these often take a while to run :>
A few parameters may need to be edited depending on use case and the file locations and slurm job settings would also need to be updated

# Mapping
The scripts in this folder are used for mapping gene IDs in protein fasta files to proteins and GO terms, and ranking them by suitability

# R scripts
These are all scripts for going through the workflow downstream from the RNAseq processing

The scripts in this directory are also numbered by deployment order and should explain clearly within the processes they are performing.

Thank you for reading and enjoy the transcriptomics analysis!
